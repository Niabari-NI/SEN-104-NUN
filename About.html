          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <hr><h3>The reason behind this</h3><hr>
          <p> This website was created due to the fact that my fellow course mates</p>
          <p>and I had some troube with understanding the notes at times. Others</p>
          <p>could not even access the notes. Then there was also the problem of</p>
          <p>not being able to get the answer to some assignments that we struggled</p>
          <p>with. Due to such problems, we would spend countless hours scrolling through</p>
          <p>the internet and in the end not get any solution to the assignments or </p>
          <p>just end up submitting absolute rubbish.</p>
          <p> This then got me thinking, "Isn't there a way to make things just even </p>
          <p>a little easier for us?". Then the idea of this website came up.</p>
          <p>To do this even turned out to be easier than expected, thanks to my</p>
          <p>ability to grasp code easily and the leassons that I was able to </p>
          <p>understand at the University.</p>
          <p> Now all I hope is that this website proves to be of as much help as</p>
          <p>I would love it to be for those entering and are still in the university.</p>
          <p>The website usage is absoluty free so please enjoy using this wonderful site.</p><br>
